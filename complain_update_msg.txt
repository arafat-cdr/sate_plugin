My initial plugin name: satellite Plugin
Directory Name Was: https://www.auroraadmin.com/wp-content/plugins/aurora-admin

She change the plugin name to : aurora-admin
And change the Directory to: https://www.auroraadmin.com/wp-content/plugins/aurora-admin

is this not a violation of copyright ? Our contract is end so why she used that ?
And also she is preparing to update the plugin to version 2 with some new feature with my same
plugin that is not paid to me !

I knew that by seeing his job post in upwork I already send the screen shot and link pls check !

When i msg her she replied thatÂ 
she developed it the she told she can photoshop that that is she is not agreeing that she stole my work
