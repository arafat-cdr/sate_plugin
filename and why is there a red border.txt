and why is there a red border?
and why doesn't the text take from the theme like any other plugin

Ans: Becuase your plugin is not fully developed form start .
You had a site and I have to usee the same css,js and php code with some additional css,js,php code
so it is for the old one

and please remove your branding "wl" from everything
ans: it is a wordPress good practise to add a prefix to stay away from conflict
I will remove and send a new version.

if anything it should be my branding "aa" for aurora admin

when I log in it takes me to the admin page which is NOT good for security
Ans: No it is not anyt security issue .

Beccausee when a admin login he see admin thing
when a use/subscribe login he see subscriber thing

So if I want to build a login page and then redirect it to manu it is a lot 
of task in your budget .. Please remember see your budget,

So what is easy in your budget i did that
